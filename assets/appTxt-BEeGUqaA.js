A **Reinforcement Learning-inspired game** where AI helps you practice 
entrepreneurship by simulating the journey of building a company. ([**screenshots**](/info))
1. **Create a Startup**: Pick a name, logo and write an idea description.  
2. **Gather a Team**: Invite friends or let strangers join your startup,
  picking roles like: \`CEO, CTO...\`
3. **Start the Simulation**:
  Based on your idea, AI generates the **initial startup scenario** you face and
  **core metrics**: \`Valuation, MRR, DAU...\`
4. **Make Decisions**: Discuss strategies with your co-founders.
  Take company **actions**.
5. **AI Feedback Loop**: The AI evaluates your decisions and updates 
  the next **scenario** and **metrics**
6. The cycle repeats: new challenges, new metrics, new decisions,
  until your startup becomes a success, fails, or you walk away.

### Actions vs. Ideas (Discussions)
- Ideas are cool,  
- But only **actions** matter.  
- Our AI only considers your **actions** when predicting scenarios and metrics.  
- **Stay real**: don't make up actions you wouldn't actually take in real life.  
  This is a game for learning entrepreneurship,  
  not for tricking the system to get scores.
