## Vision

- To build an AI-powered app that helps people find kindred spirits — whether for true love, close friendships, or project partnerships.
    - Create meaningful connections, instead of wasting people’s time with low-quality content like many existing social platforms.
    - Help users avoid the overwhelming task of searching for real connection in a sea of misaligned or irrelevant interactions — like finding a needle in a haystack.

## Problem

- Most social platforms follow a similar pattern:  
    Person `A` posts contents, and the system recommends these to Person `B` based on primitive mechanisms like tags, keywords — or even randomly.  
    The result: users must scroll through large volumes of low-quality content to find someone they truly resonate with. It’s tedious, inefficient, and often leads nowhere.

## Solution

- Let AI do the heavy lifting of finding the right people.
    - Each user chats with our AI, allowing it to understand and summarize their thoughts, feelings, and personality.
    - These `mind summaries` are vectorized using large language models and stored in a vector database.
    - Vector similarity search enables fast, efficient, and meaningful matching of users with similar minds.

- The app also uses AI to enforce strict content moderation, allowing only high-quality, thoughtful contents — ensuring a meaningful user experience.

## Market Size

- Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    - ~1.5B English-speaking, internet-connected users globally  
    - ~25% actively seek new romantic, platonic, or collaborative connections → 375M users  
    - Assuming $50/year ARPU → TAM = $18.75B/year
- Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
    - Initial focus: USA, UK, Canada, Australia  
    - Combined estimated target audience (ages 18–50, socially active): ~70M users  
    - SAM = 70M × $50 = $3.5B/year
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
    - Conservative 3–5 year goal: 1M users  
    - SOM = 1M × $50 = $50M/year
- Summary
    - Large, underserved market for meaningful digital connections  
    - Existing platforms optimize for content engagement, not human resonance  
    - *When Light Arrives* leverages LLMs + vector search to match users by mind similarity — targeting depth over volume

## Use of Funds

- I (Ricky Ding) designed, developed, and launched the MVP — now live on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.when_light_arrives.app) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/when-light-arrives/id6747026234).
- However, I lack experience in marketing and user acquisition.
- I am raising funds to:
    - Hire marketing talent to attract users
    - Hire developers to improve and scale the app
    - Set up business operations and infrastructure
