- Have you ever been disappointed by someone you loved, only to discover you held opposite values?
- Have you ever felt lonely, unable to find friends who truly understand your feelings, even with a long contact list?
- Have you ever felt powerless to pursue your passions, unable to find collaborators who share your vision?
- These problems exist because it's extremely hard to find kindred spirits on existing social platforms. 
- They use outdated recommendation systems and feed us countless pieces of garbage content that hardly touch our deeper feelings or resonate with our minds.
- When Light Arrives is an AI-era social platform that maximizes the efficiency of building meaningful connections. It takes over the tedious work of finding kindred spirits, whether for love, friendship, or partnership.
- Each user chats with our AI individually so the AI understands their mind. It converts our minds into vectors and uses vector similarity search to introduce the most similar minds to us and help us with conversations.
